        <h1>
            I was born in the small town of Safford, AZ where I grew up with my siblings and cousins all around me. Our neighborhood only consisted of my grandparents, 3 of my uncles and aunts with their children, and my family. During my junior high years I got really into Scratch because it allowed me to make games without learning a programming language. My main career goal is to successfully design and sell a web applicaiton as a freelance devloper.
